# Workflow Schema

TaskNotes Workflows persists canonical mdbase Runtime profile 0.2
`runtime_workflow` records.
The normative JSON Schema is shipped by `@callumalpass/mdbase-runtime`; the
plugin validates every newly created, edited, or migrated record before writing
it.

Workflow notes live in `TaskNotes/Workflows/` by default. The Markdown body is
user-owned documentation and is preserved when frontmatter is edited or
migrated.

## Core Record

```yaml
type: runtime_workflow
id: auto-start-time
version: 1.0.0
name: Auto-start time tracking
description: Start a timer when a task becomes active.
enabled: false

requires:
  capabilities:
    - time.write

triggers:
  - id: status-active
    event:
      id: task.status.changed
      version: 1.0.0
    x-tasknotes:
      type: tasknotes.event
      to: active

steps:
  - id: start-time
    action:
      id: time.start
      version: 1.0.0
    input:
      path:
        $expr: event.after.path

run:
  concurrency:
    group:
      $expr: event.after.path
    policy: skip
  limits:
    max_items: 1
    timeout: 30s
  on_error: stop

x-tasknotes:
  format_version: 1
  source: tasknotes-workflows
```

Required core fields are `type`, `id`, `version`, `name`, `enabled`,
`triggers`, and `steps`. Unknown core fields are invalid unless their name
starts with `x-`.

## Triggers

Every trigger has a unique `id` and references a runtime `event` contract.
Portable events use a contract requirement object. The TaskNotes extension is
only needed for executor-specific behavior:

```yaml
triggers:
  - id: canvas-drop
    event:
      id: canvas.drop
      version: ^1.0.0
    if:
      $expr: 'has(event.data.record.path)'
```

TaskNotes Workflows stores executor-specific scheduling and filters under
`x-tasknotes` while retaining a canonical event ID:

```yaml
triggers:
  - id: every-morning
    event:
      id: tasknotes-workflows.schedule.cron
      version: 1.0.0
    x-tasknotes:
      type: cron
      schedule: "0 9 * * *"
      timezone: local

  - id: every-half-hour
    event:
      id: tasknotes-workflows.schedule.interval
      version: 1.0.0
    x-tasknotes:
      type: interval
      every: 30m

  - id: manual
    event:
      id: tasknotes-workflows.manual
      version: 1.0.0
    x-tasknotes:
      type: manual

  - id: note-modified
    event:
      id: obsidian.vault.modify
      version: 1.0.0
    x-tasknotes:
      type: obsidian.vault
      event: modify
      path:
        glob: "Projects/**/*.md"
```

Supported TaskNotes executor trigger types are `tasknotes.event`,
`contract.event`, `cron`, `interval`, `manual`, `obsidian.vault`,
`obsidian.metadata`, and `obsidian.workspace`.

Contract event triggers select a portable event contract by ID and semantic
version range. `source` optionally narrows the publishing application:

```yaml
triggers:
  - id: completed
    event:
      id: tasknotes.task.completed
      version: ^1.0.0
    x-tasknotes:
      type: contract.event
      source: tasknotes
```

## Steps

Every step has a unique `id` and references an `action` contract. Input values
are literals unless represented by an expression object.

```yaml
steps:
  - id: schedule-task
    action:
      id: task.setScheduled
      version: 1.0.0
    input:
      task:
        $expr: event.after.path
      date:
        $expr: 'date(event.after.due) - duration("7d")'
```

TaskNotes Workflows owns and executes its typed local action catalog. An action
that is not local is invoked through the mdbase interoperability bridge using
its contract requirement. These are deliberately separate execution paths.

Portable action steps put the contract requirement and provider selection in
the canonical step fields:

```yaml
steps:
  - id: add-card
    action:
      id: canvas.card.create
      version: ^1.0.0
    provider:
      application: canvas-bases
    input:
      canvas_path: TaskNotes/Canvases/Completed tasks.canvas
      card:
        kind: file
        file:
          $expr: event.data.task_path
```

The bridge admits the request only when exactly one compatible provider is
selected. Run logs preserve the exact resolved contract digest and provider
identity.

The current TaskNotes action catalog includes task reads and mutations, task
relationships, time tracking, notices, selected Obsidian file operations, and
workflow control. Inspect the exact installed catalog through the TaskNotes
extension API:

```js
const workflows = app.plugins.getPlugin("tasknotes")?.api.extensions.get("tasknotes-workflows");
workflows?.listStepDefinitions();
```

## Expressions

Only `{ $expr: "..." }` objects are evaluated. Plain strings are literals.
Expressions receive `workflow`, `trigger`, `event`, `vars`, `steps`, `item`,
`today`, and `now`.

```yaml
input:
  path:
    $expr: event.after.path
  message:
    $expr: '"Review " + workflow.name'
```

Step results use the canonical wrapper:

```text
steps.query.status
steps.query.output.tasks
steps.query.error
```

## Conditions

Workflow, trigger, and step guards use the canonical `if` expression:

```yaml
if:
  $expr: 'event.after.due != null && event.after.status != "done"'
```

The visual editor may retain its structured condition representation under
`x-tasknotes.conditions`. It also writes the equivalent canonical `if` field,
so generic tools can inspect the guard.

## Iteration

Use canonical `for_each` for bounded batch work:

```yaml
steps:
  - id: patch-each
    action:
      id: task.patch
      version: 1.0.0
    for_each:
      items:
        $expr: steps.query.output.tasks
      as: task
    input:
      task:
        $expr: task.path
      patch:
        status: open
```

`for_each.items` must resolve to an array. TaskNotes Workflows stops the step
when the item count exceeds `run.limits.max_items`.

## Run Policy

```yaml
run:
  idempotency:
    key:
      $expr: 'workflow.id + ":" + event.id + ":" + trigger.id'
  concurrency:
    group: workflow
    policy: skip
  limits:
    max_items: 50
    timeout: 5m
  on_error: stop
```

Executor selection is deployment policy and does not belong in the workflow
record.

## Compatibility And Migration

TaskNotes Workflows 0.1.x used an incompatible product format with fields such
as:

```yaml
type: tasknotes-workflow
schemaVersion: 1
steps:
  - id: notify
    type: notice.show
run:
  noOverlap: true
  maxTasks: 25
  onError: stop
```

The compatibility parser continues to execute these files and the later
noncanonical `type: workflow` plus `schemaVersion: 1` variant. Loading a legacy
file never rewrites it.

Use **Migrate workflow files to the mdbase runtime format** to produce a
non-mutating analysis. The review modal shows every changed block and every
invalid file. Applying the report:

1. verifies that no candidate changed after analysis
2. writes originals and a manifest under `.obsidian/tasknotes-workflows/workflow-migrations/`
3. replaces only analyzed frontmatter while preserving Markdown bodies
4. restores already changed files if a later write fails

Saving an individual legacy workflow through the visual editor also writes the
canonical format, because that save is already an explicit user action.
