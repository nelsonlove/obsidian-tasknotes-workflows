# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- (#2076) Run log retention cleanup no longer shows ENOENT notices when concurrent workflow runs try to delete the same old detail file. Thanks to @yvos for reporting this.
- (#2077) Editing the workflow folder setting no longer creates folders for every partial path while typing. Thanks to @yvos for reporting this.

### Added

- Added contract-event subscriptions and contract-action invocation over the mdbase interoperability bridge.
- Added explicit workflow migration analysis with per-file diffs, stale-input checks, configuration-owned backups, rollback on write failure, and no startup-time rewrites.
- Added the versioned `tasknotes.workflow.run` action contract for other granted applications.
- Added Obsidian Bases formula expressions for workflow inputs, guards, and loop item selection.
- Added expression-aware date controls, OBE formula builder integration, and source input details in run history for dry-run review.
- Added a disabled default workflow that schedules subtasks one week before their parent task is due.

### Changed

- New, edited, default, and explicitly migrated workflow files now validate and write the canonical Runtime profile 0.2 `runtime_workflow` shape. TaskNotes-only scheduler and editor state is stored under `x-tasknotes` extensions.
- Legacy `tasknotes-workflow` and `schemaVersion: 1` files remain readable without mutation. Saving one through the editor is an explicit canonical conversion.
- Local TaskNotes steps now execute only in TaskNotes Workflows, while portable actions execute only through the interoperability bridge. The obsolete private runtime-host fallback and uncontracted `runtime.event` trigger were removed.
